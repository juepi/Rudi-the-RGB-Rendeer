# Rudi-the-RGB-Rendeer
Arduino Sketch for ESP8266 which implements an Access Point with a captive portal to allow control of a few different visualizations for WS2812B based LED-strips using FastLED library.
(currently mounted on a Rendeer wire frame for x-mas decoration, thus the name ;-) ).

Have fun,
Juergen
